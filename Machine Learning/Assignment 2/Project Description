Part 1:
-  This part explored different machine learning models for the Relevance Classification Task, focusing on classifying text data.

Part 2:
- The main objective is to classify the images of peopleâ€™s face to detect their emotion (Emotion Recognition). 
- In this part, three different models have been performed for Emotion Recognition: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural Network (DNN) and 
  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
